# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I combine competitive programming discipline with full-stack product execution.

My engineering mindset focuses on:
- Solving problems with optimized time & space complexity
- Designing backend systems with structured architecture
- Building scalable full-stack products
- Writing modular, maintainable, production-ready code
- Thinking in systems, not just features

Goal: Grow into a high-impact backend & systems engineer.
